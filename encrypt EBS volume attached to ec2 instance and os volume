ec2
ebs create volume same az as the instance
encrypt use the default key for now

attach to ec2 instance

login to instance

lsblk - to view all volumes
you will see the 100g new disk /dev/xvdf
to check if it has any data on it or filesystem run this command
file -s /dev/xvdf which if empty returns /dev/xvdf: data

now to make a filesystem on the volume
mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

run this command again
file -s /dev/xvdf
this time it shows the type of filesystem on the volume as ext4

now we need to mount the volume
cd /
mkdir filesystem
mount /dev/xvdf /filesystem

to unmount
umount -d /dev/xvdf
